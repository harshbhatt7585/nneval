    "Understanding Factual Accuracy & Hallucination Detection\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) sometimes \"hallucinate\"—meaning they generate incorrect or misleading information. To evaluate and mitigate this, we use different fact-checking methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### TruthfulQA\n",
    "\n",
    "A benchmark designed to measure how well LLMs avoid falsehoods across multiple categories. It contains 817 questions designed to test common misconceptions, false beliefs, and factual errors. Models are evaluated based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Truthfulness**: Does the answer align with verified knowledge?\n",
    "- **Informative Score**: Is the answer relevant and detailed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributable to Source (ATS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures whether the generated text aligns with a given source (retrieved documents, datasets, etc.). Commonly used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. Example metric: How much of the model's response can be traced back to retrieved sources?\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG-based Fact Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses external retrieval models (e.g., FAISS, ChromaDB) to verify if model-generated outputs align with real-world knowledge. The process involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model generates an answer.\n",
    "2. A retrieval system finds relevant documents.\n",
    "3. The response is compared to the retrieved facts."
